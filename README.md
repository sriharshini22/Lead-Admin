## Introduction

The LeadAdmin Application is designed to manage leads from various sources and store them in a database, with associated attributes. It also includes an admin portal that facilitates lead visualization and allows operations such as lead deletion and assignment to agents.

## Technologies Used

The LeadAdmin Application is developed using the following technologies:

- Java for backend development
- Spring Boot for Java application framework
- MongoDB for database management
- React for frontend development
- CSS and Tailwind CSS for styling

## Installation

To set up the LeadAdmin application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):**
   Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if not already installed.

2. **Spring Boot:**
   Install Spring Boot CLI or use a Spring Boot-compatible IDE.

3. **MongoDB:**

   - Install MongoDB and set up a database instance.
   - Create a database named "MassMutual" in MongoDB.

4. **Node.js:**
   Install Node.js if not already installed.

## Running the Application

### React Front-End

To run the React frontend, follow these steps:

1. In the project directory, open a terminal window.
2. Run the following command to install the required packages:

#### `npm install`

3. Run the following command to start the development server:

#### `npm start`

4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
5. The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be shown in the console.

### Spring Boot Back-End

To run the Spring Boot backend, follow these steps:

1. Open the `lead-admin-back` folder using IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Navigate to `lead-admin-back/lead-admin-back/src/main/java/com/example/leadadminback/` and locate the `LeadAdminBackApplication.java` file.
3. Run the application to establish the connection between the frontend and backend.
